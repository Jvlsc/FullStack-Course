# Part 11 - CI/CD

So you have a fresh feature ready to be shipped. What happens next? Do you upload files to a server manually? How do you manage the version of your product running in the wild? How do you make sure it works, and roll back to a safe version if it doesn't?

Doing all the above manually is a pain and doesn't scale well for a larger team. That's why we have Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery systems, in short CI/CD systems. In [this part](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11), you will gain an understanding of why you should use a CI/CD system, what can one do for you, and how to get started with GitHub Actions which is available to all GitHub users by default.
