## Introduction to React:

In [this chapter](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react), we will start getting familiar with probably the most important topic of this course, namely the [React library](https://react.dev/). 

The easiest way to get started by far is by using a tool called [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
