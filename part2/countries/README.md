## OpenWeatherMap API Key:

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

Once you have the API key, you can use it in the project by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project and adding the following:

```bash
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
